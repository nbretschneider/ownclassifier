# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

This program was written by Niklas Bretschneider.

The submission includes three main scripts or workbooks: 

Image Classifier Project.ipynb
for Part 1 of the Project

Train.py
Predict.py
for Part 2 of the Project

The code manages to achieve an accuracy of about 80% on the flower datasets.
